# Phishing-Link-Analysis

Data science and cyber security are the two boom fields in computer technology. They both are fused for numerous applications. The innovative data science methodology is used for application to work out such cybersecurity issues such as insider threat detection, intrusion detection and malware analysis. However, the stretch magnitude of data being collected and inspected has also brought about new cybersecurity challenges. Cyber security is also used in the field of data science like machine learning. To ensure the security, privacy and integrity of delicate information, cybersecurity methodologies are used in data science. For this security we use cryptographic techniques like hashing, digital signature and many other cryptographic techniques are used. In order to reduce the security threats, it should also be a key goal to integrate cybersecurity safeguard within the data science process.
